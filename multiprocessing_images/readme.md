# Image Processing with Multiprocessing

This Python script demonstrates image processing using multiprocessing to enhance performance. The script applies a Gaussian blur filter to a set of images using the PIL (Pillow) library and saves the processed images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL Fork) library
- (optional) psutil library (for CPU affinity information)

## Installation

```bash
pip install Pillow
# Optional: pip install psutil
```
## Usage
python main.py
